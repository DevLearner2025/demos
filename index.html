New Content Fragment Editor
AEM Cloud Service features a new Content Fragment editor specifically developed for headless content delivery. This editor offers improved usability and features compared to the original Content Fragment editor available in AMS. While AMS SP21 still uses the original editor, Cloud Service users benefit from:

A more intuitive editing interface

Better support for structured content management

Enhanced variation management

Improved workflow integration

GraphQL API Integration
One of the most significant enhancements is the native GraphQL API support for content fragments in AEM Cloud Service. While this capability was beginning to be introduced in later service packs for AMS, it's much more robust and fully integrated in Cloud Service:

Dedicated GraphQL endpoints for querying content fragments

Improved query capabilities for structured fragment data

Native support for headless content delivery scenarios

Better integration with front-end frameworks and applications

Content Fragment Models and Structure
Content fragment models undergo important changes when migrating to Cloud Service, affecting how structured content is defined and managed.

Enhanced Content Fragment Models
AEM Cloud Service provides more powerful and flexible content fragment models compared to AMS implementations. These enhancements include:

Better support for nested content structures

Improved field type options and validation

Enhanced reference capabilities between fragments

More sophisticated structured data persistence
